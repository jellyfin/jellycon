# EmbyCon ![Version number](https://img.shields.io/github/release/faush01/plugin.video.embycon.svg?label=version&style=flat-square) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/faush01/plugin.video.embycon.svg?style=flat-square)

**EmbyCon is a lightweight [Kodi] addon that lets you browse and play media files from your [Emby] server directly within your beloved Kodi interface.**

The key difference with its sibling [Emby for Kodi] addon is that EmbyCon does not perform any heavy synchronization between Kodi and the Emby server: instead, it **requests, fetches and caches** all the information it needs from the server **on demand**.

## Installation

### From **Emby** Kodi addon repository

This installation method will require to perform a few additional configuation, but it will also let you install [EmbyCon SkinCloner] nor to [EmbyCon ScreenSaver]:
