# JellyCon Folder Navigation Enhancement - Progress Report

## Current Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Testing & Refinement

## Overview
This project enhances the JellyCon Kodi extension to provide folder-based navigation similar to the Jellyfin web interface. The goal is to allow users to browse their media through actual folder structures on the server, not just through library views.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Main Menu Integration** ✅
- Added "Browse Folders" option to main menu
- Located in `menu_functions.py` in `display_main_menu()` function
- Uses translation string #30684 ("Browse Folders")

### 2. **Folder View Navigation** ✅
- Created `display_folder_view()` function in `menu_functions.py`
- Shows all Jellyfin library views as folder entries
- Added "All Folders" option for comprehensive browsing
- Uses "files" media type for folder navigation

### 3. **Media Type Support** ✅
- Added "files" media type support in `dir_functions.py`
- Enhanced media type detection in `item_functions.py`
- Added "folder" mediatype for folder items

### 4. **Parent Folder Navigation** ✅
- Created `add_parent_folder_navigation()` function
- Automatically adds ".. (Parent)" or ".. (Root)" navigation items
- Extracts ParentId from URL for breadcrumb navigation

### 5. **Translation Strings** ✅
Added new strings in `resources/language/resource.language.en_gb/strings.po`:
- #30678: "All Favorites"
- #30679: "Favorites by Type" 
- #30680: "Movies"
- #30681: "TV Shows"
- #30682: "Music"
- #30683: "Other Media"
- #30684: "Browse Folders"
- #30685: "Folder View"
- #30686: "File System"

## Files Modified

### 1. `resources/lib/menu_functions.py`
- **Line ~590**: Added "Browse Folders" to main menu
- **Line ~615**: Added "show_folders" menu type to `display_menu()`
- **Line ~1510**: Added `display_folder_view()` function
- **Line ~1550**: Added `add_parent_folder_navigation()` function

### 2. `resources/lib/dir_functions.py`
- **Line ~80**: Added "files" media type support
- **Line ~20**: Imported `add_parent_folder_navigation`
- **Line ~266**: Added parent folder navigation logic

### 3. `resources/lib/item_functions.py`
- **Line ~507**: Added "folder" mediatype for folder items

### 4. `resources/language/resource.language.en_gb/strings.po`
- **Lines ~1208-1225**: Added new translation strings

## What Works
1. **Main Menu Access**: Users can now see "Browse Folders" in the main menu
2. **Library Folder View**: Shows all Jellyfin libraries as folder entries
3. **Parent Navigation**: Automatic ".." navigation for going up folder levels
4. **Basic Folder Detection**: System recognizes folder items via `IsFolder` property

## What Needs Testing

### High Priority Testing:
1. **Folder Navigation Flow**
   - Test clicking "Browse Folders" from main menu
   - Verify library views appear as folders
   - Test navigation into library folders
   - Verify ".. (Parent)" navigation works

2. **Media Type Handling**
   - Test that "files" media type displays correctly
   - Verify folder items show proper icons
   - Test mixed content in folders

3. **API Integration**
   - Verify Jellyfin API calls with `ParentId` work correctly
   - Test recursive folder browsing
   - Verify folder content loading

### Known Issues to Address:
1. **Folder Icons**: May need better folder icon detection/assignment
2. **Mixed Content Sorting**: Folders should appear before files
3. **Performance**: Large folder structures may need pagination
4. **Error Handling**: Need robust error handling for invalid folders

## Next Steps for Completion

### Phase 1: Testing & Bug Fixes (Current Phase)
1. **Test Basic Navigation**
   - Verify main menu → Browse Folders → Library navigation works
   - Test parent navigation breadcrumbs
   - Verify folder items are clickable

2. **Test Content Display**
   - Verify files within folders can be played
   - Test mixed media types in same folder
   - Verify folder metadata displays correctly

3. **Fix Any Issues**
   - Address any navigation problems
   - Fix media type detection issues
   - Improve folder icon display

### Phase 2: Enhancement Features
1. **Folder Sorting**
   - Implement folders-first sorting
   - Add custom sort options
   - Group by file type

2. **Advanced Navigation**
   - Add folder bookmarks
   - Implement search within folders
   - Add folder-based playlists

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Better folder icons
   - Folder size/count indicators
   - Custom folder views

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. **Performance**
   - Add folder caching
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Optimize API calls

2. **User Experience**
   - Add folder favorites
   - Implement folder sharing
   - Custom folder organization

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Usage
The implementation uses existing Jellyfin API endpoints:
- `/Users/{userid}/Views` - Get root folders
- `/Users/{userid}/Items?ParentId={id}` - Browse folder contents
- Standard filtering parameters work for folder navigation

### Navigation Flow
1. User selects "Browse Folders" from main menu
2. System calls `display_folder_view()` to show library folders
3. User clicks a folder → System creates URL with `ParentId`
4. `process_directory()` detects "files" media type and adds parent navigation
5. Folder contents are displayed with proper folder/item detection

### Key Integration Points
- Leverages existing `IsFolder` property detection
- Uses established `ParentId` parameter system
- Integrates with existing media type handling
- Maintains compatibility with existing navigation

## Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Navigation Test**:
   - Launch JellyCon in Kodi
   - Navigate to main menu
   - Select "Browse Folders"
   - Verify library folders appear
   - Navigate into a library folder
   - Verify ".. (Parent)" navigation works

2. **Content Playback Test**:
   - Navigate to a folder containing media files
   - Attempt to play various file types
   - Verify playback works correctly

3. **Error Handling Test**:
   - Test navigation to non-existent folders
   - Verify graceful error handling
   - Check for proper error messages

## Notes for Next Developer

- The foundation is solid - existing Jellyfin API integration works well
- Focus on testing the user navigation flow first
- The "files" media type is key - ensure it handles mixed content properly
- Parent navigation should work automatically via the added function
- Consider adding folder-specific icons if the current ones aren't ideal
- Performance should be monitored with large folder structures

## Success Criteria
- Users can navigate their media through folder structures
- Folder navigation feels intuitive and similar to web interface
- All media types play correctly from folder view
- Parent/child navigation works seamlessly
- No regression in existing library view functionality
